Udacity - Android courses
============

These are my projects as part of my learning experience using the free resources from https://www.udacity.com/courses/all?search=Android&type=free%20courses 

The projects are tested for mobile phones with a screen of 6.39'' (1080x2340 pixels). You can change the resolution for your own device directly from Android Studio.

A project can be launched by opening the build.gradle file located inside of the project folder.
